# ðŸ’Ž Kyanite
Kyanite is a compiled language designed for simplicity and power. It aims to bridge the gap between simple design and more complex concepts, such as events and inversion of control.

The languageâ€™s design is inspired by other readable languages such as [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html) and [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), whilst retaining elements of more traditional object-oriented languages. Itâ€™s strongly typed with powerful compile-time type inference.

# Basic examples

The [most basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) Kyanite program can be written in only one line.

```
print "Hello, world!"
```

Letâ€™s see how the classic [fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) algorithm looks.

```
function fib(n int)
  return n if n < 2 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
end
```

# Defining objects

Kyanite is object-oriented, working with objects known as **types**. These can contain instance variables, prefixed with `@` to differentiate them from local variables which start with a lowercase letter.

Functions can be defined within these objects which then have access to the instance variables.

```
type Person
  @name string
  @age int

  function speak
    print $"Hello! My name is {@name} and I am {@age}."
  end
end
```

These can then be instantiated without needing to define a specific constructor, just by passing in explicit parameters.

```
jenny = Person name: "Jenny", age: 27
jenny.speak # prints: "Hello my name is Jenny and I am 27.
```

## Dependency injection

Kyanite makes it very easy to make an application with dependency injection as this is baked into the language.

Instance variables in a class can be marked as injected and at run-time Kyanite will inject the necessary object into the variable when it is instantiated. There is a special `with`â€¦`do` syntax that can be used to define what types should be injected and how.

```
type Worker
  injected @database Database

  function howOldIsMartina
    @database.findPersonByName("martina")?.age
  end
end

with
  Database
  Worker as worker
do
  print worker.howOldIsMartina or "Couldn't find Martina!"
end
```

This snippet instructs Kyanite that Database and Worker are the two types that it should be able to make. The Worker class is given a local variable name, so one  is instantiated immediately to be used within the `do` block (usually used to define the entry point into the application). Because Worker relies on Database being injected, a Database instance is also instantiated.

## Events

Events are a special kind of instance variable which resemble a function signature. These can be invoked, and listeners can be registered such that other parts of the code can react to an invoked event.

```
type Person
  @age int
  @birthday event(int)

  function haveABirthday
    @age = @age + 1
    invoke @birthday @age
  end
end

julia = Person age: 26
on julia.haveABirthday as age do
  print $"Happy birthday, Julia! You are {age} now!"
end

julia.haveABirthday # prints: "Happy birthday, Julia! You are 27 now!"
```

# Type system

Kyanite is strongly-typed with powerful type inference, meaning you often donâ€™t have to declare the type of local variables or functions.

```
a = "Hello!" # inferred to be a string
a = 123 # compile-time error, cannot assign int to string


function howManyEggsInTheBasket # inferred to return an int
  # do some calculations
  return 12
end

foo int = howManyEggsInTheBasket # ok!
bar string = howManyEggsInTheBasket # compile-time error, cannot assign int to string
```

## Nullable types

By default, a variable cannot be null unless stated explicitly (or inferred) with the `?` operator.

```
foo string? = "Hello"
foo = null # ok!

bar string = "Hello"
bar = null # compile time error
```
