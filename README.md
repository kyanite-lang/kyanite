# Kyanite
Kyanite is a small passion-project programming language intended to be light-weight and simple to use.

You can read more on the language itself at [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md).

## Disclaimer
Kyanite is still **very** early in development. Installation instructions are provided for the sake of development, but do not expect things to work properly for some time.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/kyanite-lang/kyanite.git
cd kyanite
make prepare
make
```
Kyanite can then be run from `bin/kyanite`. It is not recommended at this stage to add this to your path for use elsewhere (see the above disclaimer notice).
