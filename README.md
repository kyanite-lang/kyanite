# Kyanite
Kyanite is a small passion-project programming language. Intended to be simple to use, light-weight and dynamically typed, it's perfect for small embedded uses (like Lua) or other slightly bigger projects which can make good use of its simple object oriented style and built-in event system.

See [Syntax](SYNTAX.md) for a detailed breakdown of Kyanite's syntax, with some examples.
