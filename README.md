# Kyanite
Kyanite is my passion-project programming language. Intended to be simple to use, light-weight and dynamically typed, it's perfect for small embedded uses (like Lua) or other larger scale projects which can make good use of simple object oriented programming and a useful built-in event system.

See [Syntax](SYNTAX.md) for a detailed breakdown of Kyanite's syntax, with some examples.
