    Kyanite
</h1>

Kyanite is a compiled language designed for simplicity and power. It aims to bridge the gap between simple design and more complex concepts, such as events and inversion of control.

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer
Kyanite is still **very** early in development, so things don't work quite yet. But the [language documentation](LANGUAGE.md) is a good guide for how it will turn out.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/kyanite-lang/kyanite.git
cd kyanite
make prepare
make
```
Kyanite can then be run from `bin/kyanite`. It is not recommended at this stage to add this to your path for use elsewhere (see the above disclaimer notice).
