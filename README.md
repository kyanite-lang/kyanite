# Kyanite
Kyanite is a compiled language designed for simplicity and power. It aims to bridge the gap between simple design and more complex concepts, such as events and inversion of control.

You can read more on the language itself at [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md).

## Disclaimer
Kyanite is still **very** early in development. Installation instructions are provided for the sake of development, but do not expect things to work properly for some time.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/kyanite-lang/kyanite.git
cd kyanite
make prepare
make
```
Kyanite can then be run from `bin/kyanite`. It is not recommended at this stage to add this to your path for use elsewhere (see the above disclaimer notice).
